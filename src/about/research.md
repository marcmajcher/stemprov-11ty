# Current Research Projects

## STEM Graduate Students as Public Communicators
This project seeks to describe the key themes of how graduate students in STEM fields make meaning of their public engagement activities; to describe key themes of how graduate students in STEM fields describe the interaction between public engagement and their sense of belonging, and to identify/describe characteristics of STEM graduate students that may be unique to their relationship with public engagement. Funded by The Rita Allen Foundation[https://ritaallen.org/].

## Landscape Study of Art-Science Collaborations
Disciplinary-spanning collaborations between the arts and sciences may contain the potential to enrich multiple disciplines, produce knowledge, and address societal problems. However, not much is currently known about the landscape of these arts-science collaborations. This proposed study seeks to (1) compile a database of current programs at the interface between the arts and sciences and (2) obtain qualitative insights from key stakeholders in these spaces. This exploratory research aims to provide qualitative insights into the current opportunities and challenges these programs face as well as the outcomes that are connected to this work, especially with respect to cultivating inclusive and equitable spaces. Funded by [The Rita Allen Foundation](https://ritaallen.org/) and the [Burroughs Wellcome Fund](https://www.bwfund.org/).

## Performing Embodied Counternarratives of Environmental Justice
Environmental change represents a crucial issue for many University of Texas students, as this topic intertwines with culture, well-being, and aspirations. However, mainstream environmental narratives often ignore young people’s voices and rely on buzzwords (e.g. recycling), blame the individual (e.g. plastic straws), or propose solutions that exclude vulnerable communities (e.g. technofixes). And while scholars and practitioners increasingly recognize the importance of processing environmental change intellectually and emotionally, the body and the arts are often overlooked. This Green Fund-sponsored project at the University of Texas at Austin invites undergraduate students to perform their research around environmental and social change. These research-performances will serve as a platform for the UT community to collectively process environmental change and imagine a more equitable and environmentally sustainable UT. Funded by the [Green Fund](https://sustainability.utexas.edu/getinvolved/greenfund). Previously supported by [Planet Texas 2050](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/planet-texas-2050).

## Reclaiming Stem: A Healing-Centered Model For Inclusive Science Communication And Policy Training
This collaboration with Evelyn Valdez-Ward, founder of [Reclaiming STEM](https://reclaimingstem.wardofcode.com/), seeks to analyze data she has collected from applications and feedback surveys from the Reclaiming STEM workshops to share about a healing-centered model for inclusive science communication.

## Scientists on Twitter: COVID-19 and the Proliferation of Misinformation
Using scientist’s twitter account activity, we are exploring the extent to which scientists use Twitter as a strategic communication tool during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Past Projects

## Landscape Study of U.S.-based Science Communication Fellowship Programs
Professional science communication training organizations and programs appear to have grown in number and reach in recent years. Of these efforts, fellowship programs provide arguably the most intensive and impactful science communication training experiences available. Fellowship programs are becoming increasingly key to science communication practice, helping scientists across disciplines enhance their public engagement acumen and opportunities to engage. To date, however, little attention—empirical or otherwise—has focused on understanding the landscape of science communication fellowship programs. This research provided an overview (i.e., landscape) of current North American-based science communication fellowship programs. Funded by [The Rita Allen Foundation](https://ritaallen.org/).
