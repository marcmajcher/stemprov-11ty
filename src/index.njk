  Improv requires you to understand group dynamics, tell stories, and say yes in the face of the unknown.
  In many ways, improv draws upon the very same skills we cultivate as science and tech professionals.
  This beginner-friendly improv workshop will use the tools of this trade to help you become a better collaborator,
  better storyteller, and better equipped to handle the unknowns of a career in science or technology.
