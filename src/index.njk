...because science and creativity go hand in hand.

Improv requires you to understand group dynamics, tell stories, and say yes in the face of the unknown.

This beginner-friendly improv workshop will use the tools of this trade to help you become a better collaborator,

better storyteller, and better equipped to handle the unknowns of a career in science or technology.
