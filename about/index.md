ABOUT ME

I am a doctoral student in the Science & Technology Communication Lab (https://advertising.utexas.edu/research/science-technology-communication-lab) at the Stan Richards School for Advertising and Public Relations at The University of Texas at Austin, and my work lies at the intersection of science communication, applied theater, and social justice. Using mixed-methods and participatory action research approaches, I engage scientists and science communication trainers around issues of inclusion and belonging. I also use arts-based environmental activism projects to facilitate meaningful collaborations between scientists, artists, and community members.
